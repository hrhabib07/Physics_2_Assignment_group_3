## Description:
This assignment consists of two physics problems related to diffraction and interference.

1. **Problem #1: Which Slit Bent the Light More**
   - Implemented a program to determine which slit causes the most diffraction.
   - The program takes inputs for wavelength (Î»), order (m), and slit widths (a).
   - It checks the valid wavelength range (380 nm - 750 nm) and calculates diffraction angles.
   - The output determines which slit bent the light the most.

2. **Problem #2: Diffraction Grating Calculation**
   - Developed a program to calculate the diffraction angle for a second-order bright spot for red light.
   - Used given information about a third-order bright spot for green light.
   - Applied the diffraction grating formula to find the required angle.

## Implementation:
- The assignment was solved using **C++**.
- The code takes user inputs, performs calculations using physics formulas, and outputs the results.
- Proper validation for wavelength ranges was implemented.
